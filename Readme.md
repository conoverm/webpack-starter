This repo is based mainly on Webpack's introduction to Wepback.

Here's the core concepts:
https://v4.webpack.js.org/concepts/

If you read the Core Concepts page without following any links it's a pretty quick read.

Here's the Webpack Getting Started guide this starter guide is based on:
https://v4.webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

The differences between this guide and Webpack v4's guide, is this one is arranged in branches labeled by "steps". You currently checked out branch "step1". Two go to the next step, checkout branch "step2".

This guide diverges pretty quickly from the official starter guide to highlight Webpack output. At step6 it begins looking at loaders, focusing on Vue-Loader and Vue SFCs.
