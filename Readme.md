### Step 6

Now we use a loader. Let's look at Vue-Loader. It's complicated as far as loaders go and also shows just how powerful Webpack can be. Vue-Loader enables Single File Components. If Webpack didn't have Loaders then single file components either wouldn't exist or Vue developers would go need to build a system to enable SFCs.

```
$ npm i -D vue-loader vue-template-compiler
$ npx webpack
```

Did everything work?
